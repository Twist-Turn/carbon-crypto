# carbon-crypto
## Inspiration
There is a higher risk of inaccurate measurement and verification of greenhouse gas emissions. This can lead to incorrect quantification of emission reductions and undermine the credibility of carbon credits.
It becomes challenging to track the origin, ownership, and transaction history of carbon credits, potentially leading to fraud or double-counting.
Manual and Time - This can introduce delays, administrative burdens, and the potential for human errors, slowing down market operations and hindering efficiency.
Higher Risk of Fraud - Without advanced analytics to identify anomalies and patterns, it becomes more challenging to detect false claims or manipulations of emissions data

## What it does
Carbon Credit Creation Mechanism:
Identify and extract meaningful features from the data that can help predict carbon emissions or quantify emission reduction efforts.
Validation of the carbon credit:
Random Forest (ML) to improve the accuracy of emission measurements, identify emission hotspots, and validate the carbon credit creation.
Forecasting:
Linear regression (ML) is used for developing predictive algorithms that forecast future emissions based on historical data and other variables. 
Tokenize Carbon Credits:
Each carbon credit can be tokenized and recorded on the blockchain, allowing for secure and transparent tracking of its origin, ownership, and transaction history.
Testing / Performance:
Accuracy of validating the carbon credits = 99%.
Accuracy of Forecasting the emission and prediction  = 96%.
Impact of GHG reduced  = 1 metric ton of Co2 .



## How we built it
We have used html, css, js for front end which runs on flask server, ipfs for blockchain



## What's next for carbon crypto
Peer-to-Peer Trading:
Trading of carbon credits can reduce transaction costs. Thus, ensuring the integrity of the carbon credit market.
Deployed for varied infrastructure:
Smart Cities and Urban Planning, Waste Management, Transportation and Logistics and Energy Sector.
